https://capture-the-flag.testmycode.io was a beginner level CTF arranged as the last part of a [mooc](https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/) ran University of Helsinki and F-Secure. This was the first CTF that I participated "live" and was actually somewhat competing on.

While many of the challenges were quite easy and were more of a speed contest there were couple which were a bit more interesting.

There were 3 sets of challenges: 9 easy, 8 medium, 3 hard. The easy ones were released very late at night and I completed them the next day. For medium and hard I was actually doing them as they were released.

Here are writeups for the ones I thought were interesting:

[Hack a bank (medium)](hack_a_bank.md)

[Fuzzy calculator (medium)](fuzzy_calculator.md)

[Too curious cats (hard)](too_curious_cats.md)

[Cannot get in (hard)](cannot_get_in.md)

[Cracking the lost password (hard)](cracking_the_lost_password.md)

I was the first to complete all of the challenges. There were 11 medium + hard challenges which I actually tried competing. One of them was bugged and accepted a hash given in the challenge description as the flag. Out of the 10 remaining I was the first on 5, second on 2 and third on at least 1. I did cheat a little on one and you can read about that in the [Hack a bank (medium)](hack_a_bank.md) writeup.
